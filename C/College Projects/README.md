## List by Complexity

### **Arrays**

This program navigates 1D and 2D arrays in different ways. It also uses bubble sorting methods to sort 2D arrays in ascending order, and utilizes C's pointer functionalities to sort it with a pointer-by-type reference as an argument to the bubble sort function. Multiple array manipulation methods are available.

### **Sales_Tax**

This program will allow the user to calculate monthly income after deducting state tax and county tax. It relies on user input and double checks month validity.

### **Exponentiation**

This one tries to double check and test out multiple methods of exponentiation to see which ones would be correct. It tells the user method used and validates answer based on the most simple exponentiation method.

### **Multiple Operations**

This program shows the level of understanding of how operators and their order works in C. It tries to preform many different operations on 3 user inputted variables.

### **Summation**

This program will loop infinitely, adding all user inputted negative integers. When the user inputs a sentinel value, The program stops and prints the final sum.

### **Operators**

This program tests multiple operators and their usage using `scanf()` and `printf()`.

### **Product**

This program takes in 3 values from the user and finds their product.

### **Even Odd**

This program checks if a number inputted is even or odd.

### **Increments**

This program increments a value in 4 different ways and shows those ways to the user.

### **Escape Sequences**

This program tests escape sequences available in C.

### **Hello World**

Classic Hello World, the start of every programmer.

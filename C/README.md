## College Projects

This directory will contain everything I have created during my college career. From assessments or homeworks to labs. Everything is available.

## CS50 Projects

This directory contains all of my CS50 solutions. CS50 is a free independent C programming course I have taken. Everything in there is intricate and highly advanced.
